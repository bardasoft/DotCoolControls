# DotCoolControls

DotCoolControls is a .Net WinForms UI control library that contains a set of common UI controls that have advanced functionality and rich graphical interfaces.  The controls in the DotCoolControls WinForms toolkit includes a set of graphical Buttons, RadioButton, Checkbox, Panel, Label and a Datagridview (in the separate DotCoolGridView library).  These controls will utilize advanced GDI+ functionality such as gradients, customizable shapes and transparency.  The DotCoolControls also will allow for customizable behavior, graphical and text display for the various states of the control and mouse interactions.  Most of the controls in the DotCoolControls library derive from the base DotCoolControls class.  The abstract DotCoolControls class can also be extended by your own custom child controls to be used as a base class for your own custom controls.  In addition to the inheritable DotCoolControl class, the DotCoolControls library provides several graphical and template libraries that can be used in your own software projects for a variety of graphical applications.  The functionality provided in the DotCoolControls library is comparable with the feature set of many commercial .Net control libraries.  The DotCoolControls library is licensed under LGPL 3.0 software license and is free to use in both commercial and personal applications, but the original copyright and LGPL license must be distributed according to the LGPL license agreement.

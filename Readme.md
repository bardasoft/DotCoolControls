# DotCoolControls

DotCoolControls is a set of .NET WinForms UI controls and libraries that extend the functionality and layout capabilities of native .NET controls.  The controls in the DotCoolControl library will allow for enhanced appearances and functionality of the native .NET controls, without losing the benefits and features of using the native control.  The DotCoolControls can offer some sophisticated GDI+ functionality in a native .NET control that you may find in even commerical products.  In this effect, you can save yourself from purchasing expensive commercial third party controls and have full access to the components and source code in your own commerical or open source projects to allow yourself to the ability to utilize advanced GDI functionality in addition to customizing the controls to your own requirements.  The DotCoolControls will be an ongoing project and more controls will be added in the future.  As of now, the only two controls in the toolkit are the DotCoolGridView and the DotCoolButton.  




#DotCoolGridView

DotCoolGridView is a control that is derived from the native .NET DataGridView control and adds additional GDI+ functionality, such as drawing gradient backgrounds and column headers.  As well, the control will allow for alpha blending and translucent (semi-transparent) colored column headers and cells in the grid.   

NOTE: In the next version, more GDI+ featuers will be added, including more gradients, as well as the ability to add a background image to the grid, which is not currently supported out of the box with the native .NET DataGridView.    



#DotCoolButton

DotCoolButton is a control that is derived from the native .NET Button control and adds additional GDI+ functionality, such as drawing gradient backgrounds.  This control is very simple and lightweight and utilizes the button's background image property to draw a variety of gradients, so the control can retain the original .NET native button functionality with all the benefits of custom gradient drawing.  The control is so simple and easy to use, that once you try it you will never use the native .NET button control again.   

NOTE: In future versions, I will extend the capabilities of the DotCoolButton to allow for more customizable gradient settings to produce various types of effects, such as bubble, glass, plastic, etc and allow the user to customize the points of the gradient.  As well, I will allow the button to have custom drawn borders to allow for various shapes.
